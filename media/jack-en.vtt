00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:07.480
so I was told to do a YouTube video for

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.240
this assignment um just 60 seconds or

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.400
something but all things considered my

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.679
life is kind of boring but if there is

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.119
one thing that is important in my life

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:20.000
is that I am in fact a massive nerd um

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.240
so I thought it' be cool for these 60

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.320
seconds to show just two characters from

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.000
The Monster Manual of D and D it doesn't

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.000
show it but it's fifth edition so the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.160
first one

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.640
oh oh my gosh

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.640
sorry the first one is the bayor I like

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.320
him cuz he's scary and he was I think

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.960
the first monster ever fought um one of

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.199
the first D and D games I ever did was

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.199
with my uncle um at like a family

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.079
reunion and I killed this dude uh but I

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.800
didn't

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:56.000
realize one of his things is that when

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.640
it dies it explodes and I nearly died

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.399
and it stuck in with my head um another

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.760
important thing another interesting

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:06.040
thing at least is that Balor or Balor is

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.360
the name of the old leader of the tuatha

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.159
toon in in Celtic mythology also known

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.799
as like the oneeyed evil God
